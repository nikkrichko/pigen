        I am seeking a comprehensive and detailed prompt to generate images using DALL-E 3. The prompt should be constructed with a high level of specificity, ensuring that each element of the idea is vividly described and easily understandable by DALL-E 3.
        Details must to Include in the Prompt:
        Setting: Describe the location or environment where the scene takes place, considering factors like time of day, weather, and specific setting characteristics.
        Characters: Detail any characters involved, including their appearance, attire, expressions, and actions. Mention the number of characters and their roles or significance in the scene.
        Objects and Props: List any significant objects or props that should be included, describing their appearance, placement, and relevance to the scene.
        Perspective and Composition: Indicate the desired perspective (e.g., first-person, bird's-eye) and composition elements (e.g., focus points, balance).
        Please ensure that the prompt is structured clearly, with each category distinctly defined. This structure should allow for easy modification of specific details, enabling me to adjust elements as needed while maintaining the overall integrity of the idea.
        
        requirements to answer:
        it should be only prompt. ensure there are no any other comments to the prompt
