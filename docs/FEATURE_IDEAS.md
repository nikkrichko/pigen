# `pigen` Feature Ideas

Here are some potential feature ideas to enhance the `pigen` tool:

## 1. Interactive Mode

*   **Description:** An interactive mode (REPL - Read-Eval-Print Loop) for the `pg.py` script. This mode would allow users to enter commands one by one within a persistent session, rather than running `python pg.py <command>` for each operation. For example, a user could start the interactive mode and then type `idea --prompt "a cat"` then `picbystyle -i temp/idea.txt -s "Pixel_Art"` without exiting and restarting the script.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Faster Iteration:** Significantly speeds up the process of experimenting with different prompts, styles, and commands, as the overhead of script startup and environment loading is incurred only once.
    *   **User Experience:** Provides a more fluid and engaging user experience, especially for tasks that involve a sequence of operations (e.g., generating an idea, then trying multiple styles).
    *   **State Preservation (Potential):** Could potentially allow for preserving some state between commands, like the last used idea file or a default set of styles.
*   **Implementation Sketch:**
    *   Modify `pg.py` to include a new command, perhaps `interactive` or no command to launch the REPL.
    *   Utilize Python's built-in `cmd` module or a library like `click` or `typer` to create the REPL environment.
    *   The main loop of the REPL would read user input, parse it (potentially reusing the existing `argparse` setup), and then dispatch to the appropriate functions within `pigen`.
    *   Error handling would need to be robust to keep the REPL session alive even if a command fails.
    *   A clear `exit` or `quit` command would be needed to terminate the interactive session.

## 2. Web UI for `pigen`

*   **Description:** A simple web-based user interface (UI) that provides access to the core functionalities of `pigen`. Users would interact with the tool through their web browser, eliminating the need for command-line usage.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Accessibility:** Makes `pigen` accessible to a broader audience, including non-technical users or those who prefer graphical interfaces over CLIs.
    *   **Ease of Use:** Simplifies the process of generating images, especially for complex tasks like illustrating stories or trying out multiple styles.
    *   **Visual Feedback:** Allows for immediate visual feedback, such as previewing generated images or browsing available styles with thumbnails.
    *   **Centralized Management:** Could provide a gallery for users to view, manage, and download their previously generated images.
*   **Implementation Sketch:**
    *   Develop a web application using a Python framework like Flask or Streamlit. Streamlit might be particularly well-suited for rapid prototyping and data-science-oriented applications.
    *   The backend of the web application would call the existing functions in the `pigen` codebase (e.g., functions from `support.style_utils`, `openAiMain.py`).
    *   The UI would feature:
        *   Input fields for text prompts (for `idea` generation or direct prompting).
        *   Selection mechanisms for styles (e.g., dropdowns, checkboxes with style names, possibly with visual previews).
        *   File upload capabilities for story texts (`.txt`) or existing character files (`.json`).
        *   An area to display the generated images, with options to download them.
        *   Configuration options (e.g., image size, quality) could be exposed through UI elements.
    *   User authentication might be considered for multi-user environments, though for a simple local tool, it might not be necessary.

## 3. Batch Processing and Project Management

*   **Description:** Introduce a system for batch processing multiple image generation tasks and managing them as part of a "project." Users would define a project in a configuration file (e.g., YAML or JSON) specifying a list of input prompts or stories, desired styles, output filenames/locations, and other parameters. `pigen` would then process this entire batch in one go.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Automation for Large Tasks:** Highly beneficial for large-scale tasks, such as illustrating an entire book, generating a series of images for a campaign, or creating multiple variations of a base image with different styles or parameters.
    *   **Workflow Efficiency:** Streamlines the workflow by allowing users to set up multiple tasks at once and let `pigen` run them unattended.
    *   **Reproducibility:** Project files serve as a record of the generation tasks, making it easier to reproduce results or modify and rerun batches.
    *   **Organization:** Helps organize complex image generation efforts by grouping related tasks and their configurations.
*   **Implementation Sketch:**
    *   Define a clear and flexible schema for the project file (e.g., `project.yaml`). This schema would allow users to specify:
        *   A list of tasks, where each task could be an "idea" generation, "picbystyle", "multistyle", or "ill-story".
        *   For each task: input files/prompts, style(s), output file naming patterns or directories, specific parameters (e.g., number of scenes for `ill-story`).
        *   Global project settings that can be overridden by individual tasks.
    *   Add a new command to `pg.py`, for example, `pg.py batch --project_file project.yaml`.
    *   The batch processing logic would:
        *   Parse the project file.
        *   Iterate through the defined tasks.
        *   For each task, invoke the appropriate existing `pigen` functions with the specified parameters.
        *   Implement robust error handling to manage failures in individual tasks without necessarily halting the entire batch (e.g., log errors and continue).
        *   Provide progress reporting to the user, indicating which task is currently being processed and the overall progress of the batch.
    *   Consider features like task dependencies if a more advanced workflow is desired (e.g., task 2 uses output from task 1).
