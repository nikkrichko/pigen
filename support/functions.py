        Request for Detailed Prompt Creation for DALL-E 3 Illustration
        Idea Summary:
        {prompt}
        Request:
        I am seeking a comprehensive and detailed prompt to generate images using DALL-E 3. The prompt should be constructed with a high level of specificity, ensuring that each element of the idea is vividly described and easily understandable by DALL-E 3.
        Details must to Include in the Prompt:
        Setting: Describe the location or environment where the scene takes place, considering factors like time of day, weather, and specific setting characteristics.
        Characters: Detail any characters involved, including their appearance, attire, expressions, and actions. Mention the number of characters and their roles or significance in the scene.
        Objects and Props: List any significant objects or props that should be included, describing their appearance, placement, and relevance to the scene.
        Perspective and Composition: Indicate the desired perspective (e.g., first-person, bird's-eye) and composition elements (e.g., focus points, balance).
        Please ensure that the prompt is structured clearly, with each category distinctly defined. 
        This structure should allow for easy modification of specific details, enabling me to adjust elements as needed while maintaining the overall integrity of the idea.
        Identify as much main subject as possible. Ensure that the main subject is clearly separated from the background and other details.
        Each main elements hshold have own sections and onw categories of description.
        Each element of the resulted prompt should have own category and it should be easy to modify it. Split prompt to sections, as much as possible sections. 
        Each category and sub category should easy to separete and modify. Better more categories with less details than less categories with more details.
        

        requirements to answer:
        It should be only prompt. Ensure there are no any other comments to the prompt. nor any comment in the beginning neither in the end.
        there should be separate section for each element of the idea. it should be clear what is setting, what is characters, what is objects and props, what is perspective and composition.
        there should be  clear separation where is main subject and where is details.
        answer should be in yaml. but it should not contain any  quoutes n the beginning or in the end. Just text like a yaml.
        use next structure of like an example, but not limit yourself if it requires to create more comprehensive prompt.
